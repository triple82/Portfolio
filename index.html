    <p class="info">My name is Tristan Henderson.  I am an instructional coach/educator.  I was a classroom teacher for 6 years spending three of those years as a third grade teacher, two years as a second grade teacher, and one year as a sixth grade science teacher.  I have only recently become interested in learning code, which is why I am a part of this program.  I am enjoying the experience of learning and struggling to solve problems while applying what I am learning.  Below, you will find some examples of code that I have written.  I know that, as a beginner, I have a long way to go, but in the interim, I will show off what I have done.  Enjoy!</p>
